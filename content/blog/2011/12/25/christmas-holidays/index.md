Have a good end to the year!

I'm in Ireland for the holidays making the most of my time off and the awesome hospitality at my girlfriends home.

Next year I am planning to get away at least once for a spot of snowboarding, buy a tv, take first steps into the world
of I.T. Architecture, save up loads for a house and possibly brew my own beer. Whether I complete all of that is another
story.
See you all in the new year!
