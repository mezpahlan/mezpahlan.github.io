Hello!

I'm snowboarding in Oslo for three days and I can say it is a lovely place. The scenery is amazing and the snow is
awesome too. The air is a special Nordic fresh that fills your lungs with goodness each time you take a breath.

It had been pretty cold when we arrived but strangely it didn't feel like that. I supposed that was because it was not
windy at all so you didn't have the wind chill factor biting into your face.

I'm actually quite glad we got here after the travelling experience we had. First our cab to the airport didn't know
where to pick us up from despite the fact that we booked them in advance and gave them all the details of the pick up
point. When he did show up it was his first time to Gatwick and thus wasn't exactly racing to get there. Nevertheless he
got there eventually and we started to check in.

Kal and I had pro snowboarding equipment that we needed to take to the oversized luggage hold. If you have ever done
that before then you know that you can't drop it off at the same place that you drop off your regular baggage and where
you check in. Anyways, the lady at the check in desk should have given us a baggage tag after she gave us our tickets
but she didn't. So we went to the oversized baggage person and started to load our snowboards. After the first one was
eaten up by the machine, Kal's, we asked how do the handlers know where this bag is going? The idiot at the desk said we
should have added a tag to it. But none was provided. So whilst his bag was being routed to who knows where this parrot
of a man kept repeating that we should have a tag for the bag. He said this over and over again as if he was so proud he
was able to do something in his job without actually stopping the bag or telling us how to get the correct tags. He had
two tasks in his job, to check the tags and press go on the machine that transports the bags and he fucked up half of
his job. 

Eventually we get out of him that the tags are issued on the check in desk so we have to arrange for that with the
original girl who gave us our tickets. All in all poor Kal's bag had been sat in limbo for twenty minutes like some un
baptised child. 

Finally we were off and celebrated the start of our adventure with a pint of beer on the plane, Kal Ricky and I, to Oslo
to rip up the mountains and party so hard our legs drop off. More if I can find time.
