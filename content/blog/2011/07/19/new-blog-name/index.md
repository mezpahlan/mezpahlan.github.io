I'm thinking about changing the name of my blog. Big move - maybe? But I'm pretty sure I can do that with the Blogger
engine. I guess the only thing to worry about is updating people's links. But no one reads this blog anyway so what's
the problem?

{{< figure figcaption="Haters Gonna Hate" >}}
    {{< img src="haters.jpg" >}}
{{< /figure >}}

What prompted this decision is the discovery of another tech blog with pretty much the same name! And this dude posts a
lot more than me. So screw it I'll change. I was thinking something snappy and fun with my name in it. Something like:
the middle tier (yes that is sad and yes I do work in middleware). But I also blog about random stuff. Film, music,
cooking etc etc.

So I'm in search of a name. This will be my public facing blog. Something pun based would be good.

I could continue the Monkey Island references and go with: el pollo diablo! Actually that does sound good. But I will
have to check that doesn't clash with someone else's blog.

Hmm...

Maybe: a life less ordinary after my favourite song? Sounds kinda wet though? Actually I still like it.

Who knows ... Ill give it some thought.
