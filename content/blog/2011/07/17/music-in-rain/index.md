Sadly the weather is a tad inclement to say the least.

Writing a new song today. Need to come up with some lyrics also need to finalise another and polish off a third. That's
three songs. Add in a fourth from previous incarnations of the band and we might have enough to do an EP or something?

Must think of lyrics though!
