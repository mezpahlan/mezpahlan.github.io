Berlin is lovely, but very wet. I blame the best man for organising some of the worst weather for a stag do ever.

Highlights so far are the awesome beer, the best kebabs in Europe and some really creative graffiti. I think Berlin is
meant to be famous for the graffiti and how creative it can be. More art than vandalism.

Onwards to the clubs and dancing ladies!
