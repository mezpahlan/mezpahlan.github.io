We have a crazy microwave at home that seems to count in the hundreds?! Not regular time but in hundreds. Cool you may
think, the microwave is compliant with metric time! But no. Only the first hundred is observed after that it reverts to
regular sixty second time.

For example you can programme 1:80 into the microwave. This doesn't mean three minutes rather one minute and eighty
seconds which is actually 140 seconds. Huh?!?

It then counts down on the *seconds* counter from 1:80 to 1:01 and then it indicates one minute 1:00 and does a normal
clock countdown from there starting from 0:59. What the hell?!?

Stupid crazy microwave...
