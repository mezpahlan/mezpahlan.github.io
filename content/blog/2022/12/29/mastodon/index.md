A few months ago I joined the nascent social network called [Mastodon][1] and specifically an instance for Android Devs
called [androiddev.social][2]. You can find me here: [@mez@androiddev.social][3].

Mastodon is most easily described as a federated Twitter where users can join a multitude of instances and follow users
from within there own instance as well as specific users from other instances. Perhaps a better analogy is email
directly where you can message anyone where your email is hosted (Gmail / your ISP) but, of course, you can email anyone
that has an email address hosted anywhere else. The emails are shared - or federated - between different email instances
and there is no central place to get emails (even though some providers may be more popular than others). Mastodon is
the same.

There is an instance for [Kiwis][4], an instance for [general users][5], a [local instance for local people][6], and an
instance that is also [a photo sharing platform][7]. You can even [create your own instance][8] if you are into that
sorta thing. When I first joined Mastodon I briefly joined the [general users instance][5] however due to the mass
Twitter exodus at the time this instance became impossible to use so I started looking for an alternative. Luckily
enough a few Android devs from the community decided to set one up and starting taking invites so I joined
AndroidDev.social instead.

Whilst I _did_ move over during the Twitter migration I have not yet completely abandoned the bird site. A lot of people
I look up to and admired in the Android community were disgustingly let go when Twitter changed hands. Whilst this
didn't directly affect me it didn't feel right. These were some great engineers and this was no way to run a company. I
have stopped using Twitter but my account is still active. I have tried to find the users that I used to follow on
Twitter over on Mastodon. For this there is a really neat tool called [Movetodon][9] that allows you to find users on
Twitter that you follow that have referenced a Mastodon account in their profile. It is not 100% fool proof as it
requires that these users have added some text into their Twitter profile - but it is a good start.

I generally have the following groups on Twitter:

1. Friends and family.
2. Android community.
3. Local Bristol community.
4. News organisations.
5. Spanish community.
6. Formula 1 community.
7. Randoms.

At the time of posting only the Android community seem to be fully on Mastodon - probably for very similar reasons to
me. However a lot of my friends and family are not, neither are the local Bristol community, neither are the News
organisations (keep in mind I am talking about the UK ones here), neither is the Spanish Twitter accounts I follow,
neither is the Formula 1 community. The randoms that I have accrued over the past decade or more on Twitter I am
honestly not worried about. At the moment this still leaves me with a "need" for Twitter although I find I am logging in
less and less at the moment.

In a fully federated future the answer would be that each of the other groups that are not yet on Mastodon would join
their own dedicated instance and then I could find and follow them again. I think that would be a really cool thing for
the groups that are _effectively_ marketing channels like the News and F1 communities. That would be **big** if they
abandoned Twitter as I think it would accelerate Twitter's decline.

So.... I am looking forward to how this evolves and whether I will completely come off Twitter in 2023. If I can
replicate _most_ of what I had then I would be happy. Let's see.
