Eagerly waiting for Android 2.2

Watching Rage Against The Machine

Playing five a side football

Buying a new guitar

Starting a new band

Enjoying myself

Also I need to start thinking about opportunities elsewhere work wise.

I'll say it... the android auto add words to the dictionary and then use them in sentences is very annoying. Especially
when it misspells something.  Looking forward to a much better keyboard in the next release.
