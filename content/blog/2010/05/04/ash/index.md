I'm going to see Ash at the Electric Ballroom tonight. I've been a big fan since the Free All Angels album but sadly
haven't seen them yet.

They support their new album The A - Z Series which is actually a collection of 26 singles that Ash have released
throughout the year, one every two weeks.

I think it a fantastic idea that has kept me engaged with their output from the start. Unlike a normal album I'm
listening to Ash all year round instead of for a few weeks and am really liking it. In fact I'm listening to the album
now.

I'd be happy for them to just play A Life Less Ordinary since that is fast becoming my favourite song.

Really excited. Will post pictures.
