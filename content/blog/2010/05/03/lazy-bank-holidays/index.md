Today was a pretty lazy day. And that is a good thing.

My laundry is all done and sitting in the corner of my room. I nave filled up my belly with food and drink. Most notably
at Nandos. Actually I think I swallowed a chicken bone at Nandos because I have this odd feeling in my throat. Oh well I
hope it will dissolve slowly over time and not cause too much of a problem.

I'm just about to finish the book that I have been reading for the last month. "The road to serfdom" is a very engaging
read about the rise of socialism in Europe and about the dangers of a planned society however well intended.

Can you tell that this has been posted on my Android?
