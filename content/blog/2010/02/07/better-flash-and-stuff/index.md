Not much happening with me at the moment.  I went to an art gallery and took some photos. If they come out nicely I
shall post some of them!

I upgraded Flash to 10.1.51. If that means anything to anyone then you need to get out more. But in brief it solves many
crashing problems.

Very funny banter between Jobs and the Adobe CTO. Where Steve Nobs is upset that people don't like his products and
won't just buy them blindly. Adobe to their credit have a hard requirement of making a product that works on all
platforms equally as well (or badly as some say).

I'd just pull support for Flash on Apple products all together.
