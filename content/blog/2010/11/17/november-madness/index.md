Wow

Lots to write about but really can't be bothered at the moment.

Just a quick note to say that for charitable reasons I have decided to grow a thin moustache onto my face throughout the

What does this mean for me? Not much. I shave a little less above my top lip. But I raise some money for a good cause.
Prostate cancer research.
