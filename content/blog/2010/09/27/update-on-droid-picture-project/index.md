Hmm things not going well for the project.

<!--more-->

The biggest reason is that I can't code properly. Android may be very flexible but it still isn't easy to get coding
when you're a beginner.

I have signed up to the app inventor for google android, but haven't yet had a chance to play around with it yet.

Some time soon I will give it a go and hopefully this will accelerate my coding skills. Although I'm weary that it might
abstract too many of the best practice and coding lessons I wanted to gain from this project.

Oh well
