Really quick now:

I was chatting to my friend over the email communicator and I typed out this poem whilst sitting on the tube. Looking
back I think it is kinda cool.

>Oddly shaped electrical thing,  
>With all the wires 'n cables you bring.  
>You're my magnificent window to a world unseen,  
>From robots and stars to mars' moon beams.  
>Ever I ponder I will turn to you.  
>Ever I ponder you show me what's true.  
>For you are the one that connects my life,  
>Across oceans and seas to the people I like.  
>I know not what I'll do should this come to an end,  
>You're my oddly shaped electrical friend.

Hope you like it!
