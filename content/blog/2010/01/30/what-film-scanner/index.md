I am in need of a film scanner to scan my film negatives.

<!--more-->

This technology is not new but I am a bit disappointed to hear that the Linux support isn't the same as Mac/ Windows
support. 

But a quick fly through the internet and its forums reveals that EPSON might have the best support under Linux.

Anyways: I'm going to get one and see. I need to scan my 35mm and 120 film negatives because going to a shop is too
expensive now. I don't want to purchase a flatbed scanner because I have no need to scan documents. Just film.
