I've been using Lucid since it was an an alpha. The first in fact. I think I used Karmic (the previous release) for
about 2 months before I switched over.

The biggest improvement is the speed. Speedy speed speed speed. From boot up time to (which is really really quick) to
program booting speed.

There is also a big emphasis on social networking. There is a new ME menu with your avatar and quick links to social
networking tools such as your favourite Twitter client and IM support.

Artwork has completely changed with a lovely new purple theme and monochrome menus and menu icons.

A brand new boot splash screen called Plymouth adds some extra special whizz to everything.

Tonnes of other fixes and minor tweaks make the whole experience simple incredible. And it is still FREE as in free
speach AND as in free beer!!!

Also I've been following the very good [OMG Ubuntu](http://www.blogger.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk) site and Twitter feed to
keep up to the minute with the latest happenings in Ubuntu.
