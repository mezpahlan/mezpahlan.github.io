But first..... I need to get some powers.

I'm going to go all out and build an Android app and make it open source. To do this I need to be able to do the
following:

1. Program Java (since Android is based upon this excellent and ubiquitous language)  
2. Program Android (based on, but with extensions!)  
3. Install the Android SDK (Software Development Kit)  
4. Install an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)  
5. Hook up with some sort of online source control tool to keep track of what I'm building  
6. Hook up with some sort of online bug tracking tool to address the bugs that will eventually come through  
7. Create an Android Developer account so I can publish my work on the Android Marketplace  

Here is what is stopping me:

1. I can't program Java :(  
2. Thus I can't Android :(  
3. The Android SDK is for 32 bit processors. I run a 64 bit system :(  
4. My IDE of choice Eclipse has troubles with OpenJDK thus I must use the Sun version. I have no issues against that,
   but Sun (now SnOracle) don't do a 64 bit version of their JDK :(  

Frustrating indeed. I can run 32 bit applications but I vowed not to customise my system in order for this to happen
since I wanted to test how easy Ubuntu is out-of-the-box. All these frustrations would be overcome by a web based GUI
type editor for Android. If only such a thing existed..... Oh wait, it does!!

Again, this isn't open to the public yet. I have signed up (twice) and am still waiting on an invite to appear so I can
get started. Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh!!!
