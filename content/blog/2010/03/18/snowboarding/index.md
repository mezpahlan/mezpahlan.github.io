I leave for France on Saturday for some snowboarding action. I can't wait!

I want to be able to link more than 3 turns perhaps do some jumps and manage to not get snow blindness.

I've taken the controversial decision to not wear goggles. UV contact lenses. UV400!!! Is that not enough? Worked fine
for me last time. Mind you didn't snow last time.

Anyways, can't wait!
