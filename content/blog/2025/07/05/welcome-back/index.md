After a weeks out.... ok a few months.... oh heck who am I kidding there are time stamps all over this blog. After a few
_years_ away I am back!

I want to start blogging more but let's see how it goes. Here's some of the things I want to blog about.

<!--more-->

* Being a Staff Engineer.
* Working in an Experimentation team.
* Being an Android Engineer.
* Building SDKs.
* Food.
* Music.
* Books.
* Holidays.

That's a lot! See you next time.
