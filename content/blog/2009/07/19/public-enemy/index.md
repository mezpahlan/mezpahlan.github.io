I've just seen Public Enemies with Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and that French chick Marion Cotillard. So so film.
Nothing to shout about. In typical Michael Mann style it takes way too long to build up to a rather disappointing
conclusion which was made worse by the fact that you already know that the crook was going to get caught.

My verdict: about 6 out of 10. Don't go see this film on a date. Don't go see it with friends. Don't go see it unless
you like the 1930's.
