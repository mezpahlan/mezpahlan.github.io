So what have I been doing since I last posted here?

Not much. Work sleep work sleep work sleep work. That's about it.

Things I'm annoyed at:

They have managed to screw up Amarok completely now. Doesn't work properly at all. And the whole KDE4 bollocks is clunky
as hell. Not impressed.

I'm at work during one of the most beautiful summers we've had in years. It sucks I get home at 8 and am too tired to
enjoy it.

I'm going to move out of this flat. Could do with saving some money. Plus I'm not really enjoying the entente cordiale
nonsense with my flat mate.

Things I like:

Wolverine Origins the comic book series. Started off a bit poo at first but is actually quite good. Not the best thing
I've read but it does show how evil Wolverine used to be and what he's gone through to change. Interesting read.

Drum and bass for some reason? Don't know why but am enjoying streaming random drum and bass.
