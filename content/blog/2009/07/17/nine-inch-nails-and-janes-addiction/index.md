Wednesday was fantastic! I saw two childhood favourite bands, Nine Inch Nails (for the first time) and Jane's Addiction
(for the second time but the first with the original line up).

Jane's have recently reformed with their original bassist and it makes such a difference. Eric Avery is absolutely
amazing, he knows the grooves inside out and stomps around the stage. So cool. Everything you'd imagine Jane's to be.
Flamboyant guitars, crazy vocals, psychedelic bass lines, insane drumming. Brilliant

Nine Inch Nails were on a fucking other planet. Trent's vocals were amazing. And my god, he has the biggest arms now.
HAHAHA. Awesome awesome awesome set. I can't tell you how good it was. Carnage for about 2 hours. Chucking keyboards off
the stage and even a surprise visit by Gary Numan to play Cars!

Two of my favourite bands in one place. Quality.

I took this video for you.
