Today I went to see the new Sacha Baron Cohen film, Bruno. Being a massive fan of Ali G and Borat, I had high hopes for
this one. Sadly it was disappointing on all levels.

Bruno was never my favourite of the Ali G incarnations. In fact I would rate them Ali G, Borat, Bruno in that order
which just so happens to be the order in which they have been released. It could be that I am not phased by the same
stunts that were pulled in Ali G, Ali G In The US, the Ali G movie and the Borat movie.

There are some funny bits in the movie. Some absolute hilarious shockers that will leave you with a gasp on your face,
however most of the film seems pointless and childish. Where Ali G and Borat poked fun at stereotypes and
misconceptions, Bruno is just a schock fest of over the top slap stick. That wouldn't be so bad, but the schtick is few
and fleeting.

My verdict is to either wait until the DVD is released an rent it or download it if you can't wait. Don't waste you
money on it.
