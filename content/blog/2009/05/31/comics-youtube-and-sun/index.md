Today was kind of weird. I spent the whole day indoors but sun bathing sitting up against the window. Got about 3 good
hours of just lazing about next to the window topless watching Xmen evolution on youtube. Marvel have put them all up to
watch for free.

I'm still watching them now. On to season 2. I've made my self some shandy and am currently sipping it watching the rest
of the season.

I've set my self a target of downloading every single disney movie since the 1930s. There is a
[list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_feature_films) from wikipedia and I am using a usenet service to
"source" them.

I also finished reading Wolverine: Origin the comic book. Very good I liked it a lot but it took me less than half a day
to complete. I want something like Watchmen that lasted weeks. Still a brilliant comic.
