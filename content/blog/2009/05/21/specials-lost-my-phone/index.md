Last Saturday I went to see one of the all time most awesome ska bands in the world ever.... The Specials!!

It was an amazing gig at Brixton Acedemy where they pretty much played all their best hits. I loved it when Rich Girl
was played since that is my favourite song!

However....... because of all the skanking my phone must have fallen out of my pocket and I am now not the proud owner
of a Sony Ericcson W350i. It is horrible! Eeeeew! I have to put up with it until March when I can leave my contract and
get an Android phone. Good news is by then they will be even better than the Google phone 2.
