Idea is you pay for a cinema ticket for a screening that you have no clue as to what it is.

If you like film and you love the whole experience of being excited at what you see without hype spoiling it then this
is for you.

When we arrived at Clapham Picture house we sat in their bar and watched as it transformed into a Eurovision from the
seventies complete with a 'news' crew that interviewed us whilst we pretended to be the entry from Latvia.

Awesome event. We even got an intro from the film's director. [Sounds Like Teen
Spirit](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039638/).

Having said that I didn't enjoy the film. I thought it was rather boring. Watching a bunch of kids go through the
Eurovision process. Not my idea of fun. There were some funny moments mostly due to the fact that kids are stupid and
will say anything that pops into their heads.

I'll still go to another secret cinema though.
