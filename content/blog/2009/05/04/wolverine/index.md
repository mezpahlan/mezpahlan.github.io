On Sunday I saw the new X-Men Origins Wolverine.

Bloody fantastic. Hugh Jackman I take my hat off to you. I don't have a hat so I'll just thank you. Incredible.

Liev Schreiber was awesome as Sabertooth (or Victor in the film since he isn't yet Sabertooth). So was Jackman and the
rest of the cast. Reminded me of how good Spiderman was.
