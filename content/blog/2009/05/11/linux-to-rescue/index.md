My flat mate's VISTA decided to corrupt itself. Rather than telling her to bin it and get a new one I used an Ubuntu
live CD to view the hard drive and burn a back up onto DVDs.

And I did that for free. The only expense was a blank CD for the boot disc and a few blank DVDs to back up to.

How much would that have cost the MiCroShit way? Don't even try to guess.......
