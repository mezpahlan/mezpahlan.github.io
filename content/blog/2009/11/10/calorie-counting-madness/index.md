I'm basing all of this on 2500 calories a day for a healthy man.

Breakfast (Monday - Friday) - 2 slices of toast nothing on top, cup of coffee  
Lunch (Monday - Thursday) - Kid's bowl of M&S porridge, cup of coffee  
Lunch (Friday) - Burrito!!, Pint of beer  
Dinner (Monday - Thursday) - Boiled vegetables and meat (roast chicken/ grilled fish)  
Dinner (Friday) - Various alcohol based liquids  

On the weekend this a bit trickier to get a handle on but I'm going to try and eat pretty much the same.

Over the weekdays I should be getting 2500 x 5 = 12500 Calories. So let's see how much I am getting so far.

Toast = 80  
Porridge = 175  
Coffee = 5.4  
Burrito = 632  
Beer = 182  
Boiled vegetables = 20  
Meat = 500  
Fish = 200  

>"To lose 1lb a week, you need to eat 500 calories less than you use each day"

Per day I need 2500 C, I eat (average) 715 C. Daaaaaaaaaaamn!! Except of Fridays 984 C plus undisclosed amounts for
beer.

So that would mean I'd loose 2 Kg a week if I kept this up?

PAH!
