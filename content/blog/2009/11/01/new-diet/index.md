Right back from holiday and watching South Park. Holiday was amazing but now I need to detox. I'm going to try and start
a new diet which is as follows.

Substitute the calorie filled sandwich that I have for lunch with a porridge. That's it. 

The way I intend this to work is to reduce the number of calories that I put into my body. Oh and I'm also going to try
and reduce the amount of beer I drink. I find drinking wine has the same effect and much less calories.

So there it is. I can eat anything I want to breakfast. Anything I want for dinner. I just cut down on the biggest
calorie load during the day (at lunch).

Of course to get me through the day I will indulge in caffeine tablets, coffee and fruits.

In terms of exercise I'm going to try and do 15 minutes a day nothing major. Let's see how this goes?
