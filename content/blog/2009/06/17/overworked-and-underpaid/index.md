What the title says. Not impressed. I am finding myself falling asleep on the train. And not just because I am tired,
but tactically now. I don't get enough sleep so I use the train time to fall asleep.

My move to Wales scuppered. My reason for being at work absolutely wasted. And a shit load of admin and bullshit to do
for work. Nothing of which adds anything to my job.

I wonder if I can get any filming done this summer. I should get my act together and film something before the light
goes. Hmmmm need to get my thinking boots on. Grrrr.
