So Britain is in the midst of a four day Easter holiday season. The roads are jam packed out of London, Hammersmith is
burning down and I've done nothing all day but each fried chicken and watched television.

I caught up with Lost today. Man is that weird or what. From what I can tell, the island now wants John Locke to be in
charge and Ben doesn't like it. It also showed that Charles Wittmore used to be in charge of the island until Ban came
along. What then does that say about the never aging Richard? The rest of the cast and the story are quite frankly
irrelevant and not worth mentioning. Apart from Sun who is tremendously hot!

I'm nutsed off that I can't get the latest version of VLC from the Ubuntu Hardy repository. I should have 0.99 sitting
on my computer but the version (very old version) on the repository is 0.84. Oh well, I will upgrade to Jaunty when that
is fully released at the end of April and see if that has a newer version. Apparently the new version kicks ass.

I created a new Doom t-shirt. All I can say until it gets printed is that it is of Nick. Don't know who I'm going to
give it to though.

I also downloaded the new (well not so new apparently) Cure album 4-13 Dream. There are some good tracks on it, but not
liking the new shred metal guitaring that they are doing in their last two albums. I like the Cure when the guitars were
all heavily chorused and the songs were quite blatantly about love and not about wanting to slash your wrists.
