So this week starting off crap. Rain, rain and more rain. Stuck in the office well past everyone else. District line
suspended. More rain. FUCK!!

<!--more-->

Stupid trains.

But it was all worth it. The 14 hour work day. The rain. The suspension of my only means home. One thing made it worth
while.

The awesome fish and chips that I got on the way home!! Love it.

Some good news work wise. I finally have a date I can leave this project and go try something else. That means a lot to
me. To try something new.

The gym was the icing on the cake. Roll on Wednesday and the bank holiday!
