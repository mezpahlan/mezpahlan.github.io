The new Ubuntu is only 5 days away. I can't wait. It has been a year since I started my trip down Linux lane and am
enjoying it more and more.

The only thing that I find annoying and that Windowz has over Linux is out of the box capability. But that's not
something the OS can sort out rather vendors need to have more support for open source tools and platforms. This is
getting better but some things are a pain to get right. For example a 64 bit version of Flash. There are work arounds
that I don't mind employing but its not really suitable for everyone. You have to be some sort of geeky to do it. I
still haven't seen a good video editing suite either.

But not to worry I'm still sticking with Linux. Windowz just plain sucks!

I'm looking forward to updating both Amarok and VLC and getting the increased boot speed that Jaunty has. Apparently it
boots in only 20 seconds. Cool.
