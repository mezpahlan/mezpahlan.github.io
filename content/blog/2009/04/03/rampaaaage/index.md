Last night I rampaged through London.

Tonight I will rest and catch up of many hours of TV.

Good news is that child stealing wench madonna has been denied adoption rights. I am pleased. Thief. Not likely she will
try and stay in Malawi for 18 months to qualify either. Most likely a change in the law will happen allowing her not to
have to stay in the country for that length of time before she can steal another child, followed by the changing of
money across hands.
