7 days to go till a new version of Ubuntu is released!! That's my geekness done.

I'm watching Hollyoaks at the moment, it's teetering along.... nothing major happening that is interesting me. That's
why I'm streaming it and only listening to the audio.

I feel like doing a round of gin. No three rounds! No a whole bottle. Screw it I just want to get wasted on gin. Haven't
done that in ages.

Reminds me of a time I got so wasted on Malibu that I fell into a girls lap. Face first. Don't worry....... she didn't
mind. I also proceeded to fall off a bass amp. Break my glasses onto my nose and lock myself in a toilet. Hahahaha those
were the days!
