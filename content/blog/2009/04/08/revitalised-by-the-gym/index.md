Go to the gym everyone. It feels good. Plus there are beautiful people there!

<!--more-->

Life is becoming very repetitive at the moment. I need a change of scenery. For how long I don't know.

I need to focus and finish this project off and then........ well then I'm out of here. Gone. Vanished! Into the ether.
Well a two week holiday anyway.

Things I still need to do:

1. Hack Wii to make it a media centre. I am fed up of watching stuff on my computer when I can stream it to my
   projector.
2. Install Ubuntu on my work laptop. Tee hee hee.
3. Upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04 on my home computer.
4. Set up a blog to write about switching to Linux.

Things I am still waiting on:

1. A fucking fix to stop libflashplayer.so 64 bit randomly crashing and killing Firefox. This is driving me nuts!! About
   50% of the web is inaccessible! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
