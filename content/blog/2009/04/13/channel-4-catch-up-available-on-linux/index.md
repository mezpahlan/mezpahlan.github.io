OMG!!

[4OD](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/4od) is now available in streaming flash format!! Much like [BBC
iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/)! This means a move away from crappy wmv formats and a step in the right
direction for support for other OSs such as Linux and macs.

Go Channel 4!!
