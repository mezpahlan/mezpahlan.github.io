I crashed into 3 people on my tube journey today.

<!--more-->

An asshole who swung his bag around to dramatically change direction whilst getting a paper. What the fuck? You couldn't
hear me running right behind you. Dick. Bashed my hand up on that one.

Some fat dude at Ealing Broadway. Right into the ribs. To be fair we were both running for our tubes and just crossed
paths.

Another fat shit at Victoria who tried to trip me up because I cut him up running for the train. He was walking so
slowly. Get out the way idiot!.

I'm not this mean normally.

Here are some pictures of something fluffy.
