Friday saw us visit the Kensington Roof Gardens for a friends birthday. Fantastic place as usual. I think we made the
right call by getting completely wasted before we went in because drinks were fantastically expensive.

I don't remember how we all got home such was the brilliance of the night. I'm a bit out of it today though, as you can
probably tell.
