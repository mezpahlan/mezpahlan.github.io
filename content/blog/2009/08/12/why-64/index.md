A combination of a 64 bit build of Ubuntu, 9.04, 64 bit flash and an absurd naming of Firefox 3.5 have driven me to
install a 32 build of Firefox onto my 64 bit machine. It means I can run flash 32 natively and without glitches and that
my internet bank now recognises Firefox 3.5 instead of Shiretoko which it blocks access to.

Thanks to [Ubuntuzilla](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ubuntuzilla/index.php?title=Main_Page) I am now running,
what seems, a fantastically more stable internet browser which seems quicker too!

For some barmy reason the powers that be over at Ubuntu central have decided not to call the latest update for Firefox
by its actual name instead by a barmy code name Shiretoko. This means that my online banking service doesn't recognise
it as a standard browser. I'm sure you can hack it to display the word Firefox but to me Ubuntu have broken Firefox. I
want to have the latest version of my favourite internet browser and I want to continue using my online bank. Ubuntu
have messed that up. However the community comes to the rescue with Ubuntuzilla. It is a script that downloads the 32
bit version directly from Mozilla and customises almost like the Ubuntu build but better it seems.

An added benefit to this 32 bit build is that I can use the 32 bit Flash 10 that doesn't break Firefox like the 64 bit
version did. Now the internet is back in my hands!

So my question is why should I bother with the 64 bit build? Or the Ubuntu build for that matter. They are less
compatible and slower and less stable.

I've posted my question [here](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1238676) on the Ubuntu forum. Lets see if I get
a reply!
