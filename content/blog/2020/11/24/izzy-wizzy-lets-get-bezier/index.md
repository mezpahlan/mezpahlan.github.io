This week I've been focussed on improving the biometric setup journey for the app that I work on. I've taken the
opportunity to add a little bit of fun / delight into the setup process and learn more about [Animated Vector
Drawables](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/drawable-animation#AnimVector) in Android.

This post aims to recap what I learned when working with Animated Vector Drawables (AVDs). 

<!--more-->

There a number of ways to provide animation type effects in Android from simply using what you are given in the Android
framework, providing a video, to using the popular [Lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/) framework by Airbnb. For what I
wanted to achieve using a video would be too resource intensive. Plus where was I going to make / get a video from? Also
using Lottie would have been a good idea too but I wanted to find some way of doing this on my own using the software I
already had. I don't own any of the Adobe suite. I'm a
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) kinda guy. So the choice for me was clear, to use
what was available out of the box using the Android framework. I already knew that Android had good support for [vector
graphics](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/vector-drawable-resources) and I knew that you could
animate vectors very easily, so I set to work.

# SVGs And Vectors On Android

Vector graphics are great! They're tiny, and infinitely scalable. They're great for icons, especially flat style ones.
[Android supports a subset of the SVG
spec](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/VectorDrawable) (why a subset - I don't know but
I'm guessing "performance"). If you're familiar with working with SVGs you should feel comfortable with Android Vectors
as the semantics are _pretty similar_. However that's like saying, "just use a regular expression". It's easier said
than done. 

So how do SVGs work? Remember those Roamer plotting robots from primary school?

{{< figure figcaption="[Roamer plotting robots](http://www.valiant-technology.com/uk/pages/roamer_home.php)" >}}
    {{< img src="roamer.gif" >}} 
    {{< img src="roamer-2.jpg" >}} 
{{< /figure >}}

As well as being a fun educational tool they were actually teaching your 6 year old brain about [Cartesian coordinate
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) and [BÃ©zier
Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). Bastards... I know right! That's all there is to SVGs
fundamentally. It's a language to draw points and curves between them expressed as a set of coordinates and instructions
for how to go from point to point. For more (and better information) check out [MDNs tutorial on
SVGs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial).

For example if you want to draw a line you would express this in SVG by drawing a `path` with some start coordinates
followed by intermediate coordinates  describing what you want to plot. For example `M 10 10 L 90 10` means:

1. Start at coordinates (10, 10) - that's what `M` means in _(x, y)_ space.
2. Draw a horizontal line to the coordinates (90, 10) - `L` means Line... duuh.

You can combine these instructions to draw shapes such a square:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<svg>

  <path d="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z"/>

</svg>
{{< /highlight >}}

Which means:

1. Start at coordinates (10, 10).
2. Draw a line to the coordinates (90, 10).
3. Draw a line to the coordinates (90, 90).
2. Draw a line to the coordinates (10, 90).
2. Close the path back to your start - that's what `Z` means.

Produces a square just like that little robot from primary school!

{{< figure figcaption="A square drawn with an SVG." >}} {{< img src="path-line-command.png" >}} {{< /figure >}}

You can also draw curves using the notation `C x1 y1, x2 y2, x y` where `x1 y1` is the first control point `x2 y2` is
the second control point and `x y` is the end position of the curve. Now this _does_ get a little more complicated but
thankfully it's about as much as you need to be aware of.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<svg>

  <path d="M 10 10 C 20 20, 40 20, 50 10" />

</svg>
{{< /highlight >}}

Which means:

1. Start at coordinates (10, 10).
2. Draw a curve to the coordinates (50, 10).
3. Control point 1 is at (20, 20).
2. Control point 2 is at (40, 20).
2. Make sure the curve passes as close to both control points as possible whilst also ending up at the end coordinate as
   well as being smooth..... phew!

Produces:

{{< figure figcaption="A (teeny tiny) curve drawn with an SVG." >}} {{< img src="curve-command.png" >}} {{< /figure >}}

You can hopefully see that drawing this way means that the image size and clarity win big. Text can be compressed a lot
more easily than an image and expressing the image in mathematical terms allows for greater scalability. SVGs / vector
images are not great for everything so depending on your needs you might still have to use a [rastered
image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics).

SVGs can get _a lot_ more complicated and there are different ways to express doing the same thing but they all (pretty
much) boil down to this. I'm by no means an expert but armed with this much knowledge I can tackle vectors in Android.

# Android Vectors And Animation

The same in Android looks remarkably similar:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

   <path android:name="line" android:pathData="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z" />

   <path android:name="curve" android:pathData="M 10 10 C 20 20, 40 20, 50 10" />

</vector>
{{< /highlight >}}

Notice that this looks almost identical to the SVG. It would be great if the format was the same but in the grand scheme
of things this isn't too bad. At least we don't need to embed a vector in a PDF!

Android allows you animate the `pathData` easily so that you don't have to worry about animation frames and rendering
and all that complicated stuff. You simply specify _where you start from_ and _where you want to end_ and let Android
(mostly) do the rest. Here's how you would animate a line to a curve.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<animated-vector
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:aapt="http://schemas.android.com/aapt">
    <aapt:attr name="android:drawable">
        <vector
            android:width="24dp"
            android:height="24dp"
            android:viewportWidth="24"
            android:viewportHeight="24">
            <path
                android:name="line"
                android:pathData="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z" />
        </vector>
    </aapt:attr>
    <target android:name="line">
        <aapt:attr name="android:animation">
            <objectAnimator
                android:propertyName="pathData"
                android:valueFrom="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z"
                android:valueTo="M 10 10 C 20 20, 40 20, 50 10"
                android:duration="300"
                android:interpolator="@android:interpolator/fast_out_slow_in"
                android:valueType="pathType" />
        </aapt:attr>
    </target>
</animated-vector>
{{< /highlight >}}

Woah! Now that's got a lot more complicated but it's not really! It is simply a bunch of files representing a vector
drawable and some animations in a single file so that they are encapsulated. Let's break it down.

The top part of that file is simply the base vector. It simply describes a line. The main portion of that should be
familiar from before.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<animated-vector
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:aapt="http://schemas.android.com/aapt">
    <aapt:attr name="android:drawable">
        <vector
            android:width="24dp"
            android:height="24dp"
            android:viewportWidth="24"
            android:viewportHeight="24">
            <path
                android:name="line"
                android:pathData="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z" />
        </vector>
    </aapt:attr>
    ...
</animated-vector>
{{< /highlight >}}

When an Android build runs the `AAPT` tool will separate files and replace the data here with references back to those
files. This explains the extra attributes such as `aapt:attr name="android:drawable"`. This tells `AAPT` that what comes
in-between the tags is a `drawable` and thus it knows where to place the file and how to treat it. I like to think of
this as resource merging in reverse. This process allows us to specify a single file that is actually a bunch of files.
Of course, you can also specify them separately if you want.

The next part to describe are these extra attributes describing the `width` and the `height` as well as something called
`viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight`.

{{< highlight xml >}}
<animated-vector>
    ...
        <vector
            android:width="24dp"
            android:height="24dp"
            android:viewportWidth="24"
            android:viewportHeight="24">
            ...
        </vector>
    ...
</animated-vector>
{{< /highlight >}}

The purpose of these are the same as their equivalents in SVGs. It is to describe the `width` and `height` of the image
(duuuh) and also the natural / intrinsic dimensions. If you remember the numbers in the `pathData` are representations
of a coordinate system. Well, how far to the `x` direction is `10`? How far to the `y` direction is `90`? That's where
the `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight` come in. A viewport is basically the virtual canvas where the paths are drawn
on. Feel free to adjust the `width` and `height`. Don't mess about with the `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight`
otherwise you'll have to redo all the numbers in the `pathData`, which is a pain.

Lastly let's review the animations:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<animated-vector>
    ...
    <target android:name="line">
        <aapt:attr name="android:animation">
            <objectAnimator
                android:propertyName="pathData"
                android:valueFrom="M 10 10 L 90 10 L 90 90 L 10 90 Z"
                android:valueTo="M 10 10 C 20 20, 40 20, 50 10"
                android:duration="300"
                android:interpolator="@android:interpolator/fast_out_slow_in"
                android:valueType="pathType" />
        </aapt:attr>
    </target>
</animated-vector>
{{< /highlight >}}

Again, you can reference this in the same file or the separately - `AAPT` will take care of that for you. Hopefully this
is a self explanatory. The main take away points are:

1. Where this animation should run - the `target android:name="line"`.
2. What it should do - animate the value from `android:valueFrom` to `android:valueTo`.
3. What the values should be interpreted as - `android:valueType="pathType"`
4. How long it should take - `android:duration` this is in milliseconds.

The last attribute, `interpolator` isn't important if you're starting out. Choose the one above. But it can be very
powerful if you want to control exactly how the animation progresses. The `fast_out_slow_in` simply means _towards the
start of the duration animate through frames quickly but slow down towards the end of the duration_. This gives a
pleasant easing effect but there are others [described visually on this
page](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/android-interpolators-a-visual-guide).

And that's it! You have an Animated Vector Diagram, congrats!

Waiiiiiiiit a second. How do I _actually_ use this knowledge?

# Not By Hand

Obviously trying to do this by hand for anything but the most simplest of shapes would be an act of sheer folly. I don't
recommend trying. Figuring out the paths is rather complicated and time consuming. Fortunately there are some good tools
/ resources to help with this.

You can source SVGs from many places on the web. For Android I recommend starting at
[material.io](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline). Here you can find a number of icons in many
different formats. You can use them freely as they are licenced appropriately and you can use them on a number of
platforms because they have outputs for all the major platforms. You can also get something similar from Android Studio
by opening the Asset Studio.

{{< figure figcaption="Asset Studio in Android Studio" >}} {{< img src="asset-studio.png" >}} {{< /figure >}}

Sadly that's where good tool integration stops with Android Studio. If you want to do any sort of non minor editing of
the vector you're out of luck. There isn't an editor apart from the XML editor. That sucks. There are FOSS tools to help
you though. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a great vector design editor. However the learning curve is pretty
steep. You might be like me and install it on every computer you own only to get frustrated and give up. If I keep
practising I might get the hang of it but for a one off task it is a bit too much for me to learn.

So what is the tool you need? [Shapeshifter](https://shapeshifter.design/) by [Alex
Lockwood](https://github.com/alexjlockwood). Actually I wish that this was simply integrated into Android Studio. It's
so good!

{{< figure figcaption="Randy from South Park in a Clockwork Orange?" >}}
    {{< img src="shapeshifter.png" >}}
{{< /figure >}}

This tool really is amazing! You can edit an SVG / vector on it's own as well as adding animations in a user friendly
way. Best of all is that any issues with incompatible paths or canvases can be auto-fixed from within the tool itself.
The best feature from my point of view is that it offers a video editor layout to time the animations. This is super
useful when you want to chain one animation next to another. Or run multiple animations at the same time.

When you're done you simply export the Shapeshifter session to a format that you prefer. It supports SVG, Vector
Drawable, Animated Vector Drawable, SVG Spritesheet. So basically if you want to publish to Web or Android. Sorry but
for the time being it doesn't support attaching a vector to a PDF.

Back in Android Studio you now need to set the AVD as the source for an `AppCompatImageView`. The animation doesn't
start playing automatically so in order to start you need to get a reference to the `Drawable` in code and manually call
start. Something like this:

{{< highlight kotlin >}} val avd = binding.imageView.drawable as AnimatedVectorDrawableCompat

avd.start() {{< /highlight >}}

And that's it! You have an Animated Vector Diagram, congrats!

...

Waiiiiiiiit a second. What do I _actually_ do?


# Think Differently

To start with you need to think differently about the creation. Whilst the animation makes everything look fancy you'll
do well to break it down into key parts. For the animation at the top of the post there's several _parts_ happening.
Some of them happen at the same time. This is where Shapeshifter shines because it makes this really easy to manage
using the "video editing" layout.

1. We start the animation on a vector that represents a fingerprint.
2. This is actually broken down in to several paths. 
    * One for each _ridge_ of the fingerprint. 
    * This means we can animate them separately. 
    * It's a lot of work initially but it makes the process much easier in the long run.
3. An animation runs to transform the fingerprint into the face.
    * The top ridge morphs into the full circle of the face.
    * The ridge below morphs into the central face. This is cleverly shaped to also denoted the hairline.
    * The next two ridges morph into the left and right eye.
    * And finally the last ridge simply disappears.
4. Next, from the face we animate to the eye.
    * The circle morphs into the [sclera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclera).
    * The left eye morphs into the iris.
    * The right eye morphs into the pupil.
    * And the centre face area simply disappears so that the eye is formed.
5. After this comes the HL logo.
    * The sclera morphs into the H.
    * The pupil morphs into the L.
    * The iris disappears.
6. Some this is animating from one path to the other and some of it is changing the colour or alpha values
   appropriately.
7. The animation is looped once back to the beginning.

Breaking this down bit by bit makes the animation more manageable. At speed the illusion fools you into thinking it is
one seamless transition. Something similar was done for the final fingerprint to tick animation. Although this was much
simpler I actually didn't end up using Shapeshifter for that.

# Gotchas

All in all I think this took me about a day to get the basics down and complete and then another full day figuring out
small bugs and finer details.

Clip Paths. I don't understand these. I know it has something to do with excluding areas. Negative shapes, if you will.
But I don't know how I could have used this in this project. Maybe I didn't need to. Clearly I didn't.

Tinting. I started off tinting the `AppCompatImageView` in Android in order to colour it. This worked well until the
animation reached the eye stage and I noticed the sclera was not showing. Tinting was the wrong thing to do for how I
had created these vectors. I _know_ that it should work such that I can simply tint the `AppCompatImageView` associated
with this drawable for maximum flexibility. In the end I hard coded the colours in the XML of the AVD. Ewww. That
reduces the flexibility if I want to use this is other areas. But I don't so meh....

The worst part about this process is the really bad APIs for listening to the state of the animation. If you simply want
to start and stop the animation then you'll be fine. But if you want a callback to notify _when_ the animation starts /
ends so that you can then do something else then the APIs are seriously messed up. Mark Allison explains this much
better than I can in his series Animatable2 [part 1](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/animatable2-part-1/) and [part
2](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/animatable2-part-2/). Also a big thank you to Nick Butcher's blog
[Reanimation](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/re-animation-7869722af206). Both talk about a similar problem in that
even though there is an androidx library for this you can quite easily get caught out and use the wrong API leading to a
full blown crash depending on how your vector drawable was added to the image view. It turns out there are _two_ APIs
that do exactly the same thing but are not compatible with each other at all. To make matters worse different versions
of Android will return you a differently cast `Drawable` so you have to write a lot of boiler plate to be safe. There's
some good tips in those blogs but at the end of the day I didn't think it was worth it. Maybe I'll write my own
extension function if I can be bothered to hide the complexity. But I feel something like that should really be offered
by the androidx library.

So, yes, you can muddle through it and produce a really cool effect. But it needs to be way easier. That said, just like
regular expressions, it does make you look something like a wizard!
