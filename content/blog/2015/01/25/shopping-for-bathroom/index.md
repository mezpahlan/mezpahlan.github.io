One of the exciting events to happen this year is that we are buying our first house. We are moving just down the road
in Bristol to a three bedroom terraced house. The house itself is a Victorian house that has been recently renovated so
needs minimal work once we move in.

Whilst we won't need a complete remodel, one of the rooms that we do want to start from scratch again with is the
bathroom. So this weekend we have dedicated to watching [The Good Wife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Wife) and
viewing bathrooms.

One thing I will say is that as lovely as the internet is you can't buy something like that online. Of course it is
possible to purchase the individual items online but what you will find extremely difficult is to buy a feeling of
comfort online. So whilst I usually do tend to favour online purchases I would highly recommend visiting a store and
using the show room items. All right, all right.......... maybe don't actually use the bathroom items but certainly sit
on the toilets and step into the showers.

This Saturday we visited the Bristol branch of [Bathroom Village](http://www.bathroomvillage.com/bristol) and spoke at
some length to the branch manager, Neil.What a difference that made! He was very patient and wonderful to bounce ideas
off. You could tell he was very passionate about his work. If you are anything like us then chatting with someone who
knows their stuff really helps tempering the crazy wild (and expensive) ideas that we had.

Whilst we haven't finalised our choices I think we are steering towards a look that we would like.

#### The toilet pan and cistern:

Classic looks with a low level cistern as a compromise to a high level that we think looks nice but would look out of
place in our new bathroom.

#### The basin and an underneath cabinet:

    {{< img src="sink-cabinet.jpg" >}}
{{< /figure >}}

The only change is colour and the basin we require has three tap holes for the following.

#### Taps for basin:

These do not technically match the range that the other two items come from but they look so good!!

#### Shower:

{{< figure figcaption="Shower" >}}
    {{< img src="shower.jpg" >}}
{{< /figure >}}

We are only considering a shower. A bath would not fit in the new bathroom. The final shower enclosure is still yet to
be decided but the shower tray might look something similar to this black slate tray.

#### Tiles:

To save some cash we might only tile the splash areas around the sink and the shower and paint the rest of the bathroom.

#### Bathroom heating:

This looks pretty swish and doubles as both a radiator and a towel rail.

That's it for now. We still need to decide on the flooring, the shower heads, the type of shower, and how we are going
to lay all of this out. An exciting project! Let me know if you have any tips on designing a bathroom or just tips about
the process as a whole.
