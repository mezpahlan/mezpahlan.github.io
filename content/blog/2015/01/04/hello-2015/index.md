Hello 2015!!

I started off last year with a blog post and then got side tracked. And then throughout the year I got side tracked some
more. And then, well......... I sort of was on a roll with getting side tracked and decided to not post any recipes,
geeky updates, random blog thoughts for the entire year. Well we started a new year this week and I'd like to make
amends!

<!--more-->

I'm going to try and blog more often this year. I should (hopefully) have more things to blog about which will make
blogging easier. I have some new toys to try out and, fingers crossed, will hopefully have an even bigger toy to show
off fairly soon too.

I also want to continue with the recipe blogging. I'm looking for some interesting things to try out. I think lamb would
be a nice thing to explore this year. If you have any good recipes for lamb, do let me know!

I also want to take more pictures, I should really go around town (Bristol) and take some pictures on my own. So I will
try and get some pictures up here as well.

Finally I really want to give myself a kick up the back side with my programming. I have to launch a new website and an
Android app this year. I just need the momentum with me. Must. Not. Be. Distracted!!

So I guess you could call this a New Year's Resolution blog post. I won't. But I suppose you can.
