I have become very addicted to streaming video and TV series in particular. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) has been
my go to choice for this. Although I also still enjoy *traditional* methods.

Here's a list of shows I've been watching. Any recommendations for something I might enjoy?

* The Good Wife
* It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia
* Archer
* Gotham
* Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D
* Agent Carte
* The Killing
* Lillyhammer
* House Of Cards
* Game Of Thrones

It certainly takes the boredom out of the weekends!!
