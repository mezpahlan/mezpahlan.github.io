I spotted this recipe for [spicy chicken wings](http://www.munchkintime.com/oven-baked-chicken-wings/) on Google+ and
thought I would give it a go. I wanted to put my own spin on it which is why I opted for chicken legs instead of wings
and modified some of the ingredients. I also didn't want to buy thirty chicken wings! The recipe does use ketchup but
bear with me, it's not that bad.

Preparation time: How quickly can you chop garlic? 10 minutes.

Cooking time: Depending on chicken used around 40 minutes .

#### Ingredients:

* Chicken legs (any chicken is all right for this so select your favourite!)
* Squirts of ketchup
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise<
* Paprika<
* Chipotle sauce
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 4-5 cloves garlic (chopped)
* Brown rice

#### Method:

In a bowl add the ketchup (fancy ketchup is better than off the shelf stuff) and mayonnaise. Mix quickly together with a
spoon. Then add the salt and pepper, paprika and Chipotle sauce. Here is where you can tweak the spiciness of the
recipe. If I were to do this again, I would use a much spicier sauce. As it was, the chicken was lovely but I would have
preferred less of a sweet taste.

Chop the garlic into fine cuts and mix into the sauce you have created. Now wash the chicken and throw them into the
bowl with the sauce. Get your hand in and make sure every chicken is covered in this sauce. Leave for 12 hours to
marinate in the fridge.

When you are ready to eat, preheat an oven to 220 Â°C. Empty the now thoroughly marinated chicken into an oven dish and
cook for 40 minutes turning occasionally. Separately, cook the rice as you like it.

That's it! Very easy to prepare, very tasty to eat. You can add little twists to the recipe to suit your tastes! I
reckon I'll get four easy meals out of a tray of eight chicken legs. Bargain.
