A week after coming back from snowboarding I felt a little nostalgic for all the yummy food I had been missing.

I bought three saucisson back with me from France. One peppered (I didn't like that too much), one with cheese in it
(that was lovely), and one plain one (that was nice too but not my favourite). This is pretty much what we had after a
day on the slopes. To compliment this I had some whisky. I'm starting to become a big fan of Islay whiskys. I enjoy the
smokey peatey taste that they are known for. This one here is an Ardbeg but on the trip we had a much nicer bottle of
Lagavulin.

The other treat we had were cakes! Oh so many cakes! This weekend I sat down and attempted to make my own cake based on
a [sticky orange
cake](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2017/feb/02/how-to-cook-the-perfect-sticky-orange-cake)
recipe by Felicity Cloake. I didn't use the orange candied orange peel in the original recipe and used waxed oranges out
of sheer laziness but other than that I followed it to the letter. And it is scrummy! It's also the first cake that I
have baked that doesn't use flour. Feels very weird at first but you make up for it using ground almonds. It feels much
lighter than my normal cakes. But then it does also contain a lot more sugar! So you win some you lose some!

Oh and hello to my new readership!
