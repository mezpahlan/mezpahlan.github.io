<!-- - You have found my secret review of the film Silence! Congratulations.

I liked this film. I liked it a lot. I was expecting a deep introspective into the nature of faith and that is what I
ended up watching. I wasn't moved by it in a religious sense because I am not a religious person, however I don't think
that took anything away from the film. Whilst it is a long film it manages to present both the sense of peace that
unwavering faith brings and also the doubt when faced with the harsh realities of the world.

Both Liam Neeson and Adam Driver offer excellent supporting performances as the mentor of two Jesuit priests missing in
Japan and one of the priest sent to locate him. However the main stand out performance for me was Andrew Garfield as the
other of the priests sent to look for Neeson's character. Along the way they meet a Japanese Christian called Kichijiro
played by YÃ´suke Kubozuka. His story is also pivotal to the main plot as it mirrors one of the films themes of the
changing nature of faith.

For me the film's key argument is the discussion of the differences between someone that has faith and the someone that
does good. Most of the time they would overlap however in extreme there is a disjunction between the two. Are you a
person of faith when your faith gets you and others killed? Or are you a person that does good by renouncing their faith
knowing it will save lives? What is the consequence of keeping your faith and who does that ultimately benefit? Yourself
or others?

I liked that the film did not end with one interpretation being correct over the other and whilst at times I wished it
was shorter in length, I ultimately really enjoyed the film. It still has me thinking about it a week later!
