Last week I went to Méribel in France for some snowboarding with friends.

We went to the same resort last year and loved the area and the runs as well as the chalet company that we stayed with,
[Ski Basics](https://www.skibasics.com/). Last year we went in the first week of March however this time for scheduling
reasons we chose to go towards the end of January. Whilst the resort was still pretty good and the runs were as we
remembered, there was a distinct lack of snow which made for some challenging conditions. The forecast was never good
going into the trip, the area had a dump of snow about ten days before we arrived and very little snow fall since.

Nevertheless we made the best of the conditions and had a good time. Ice isn't so bad if you know it is there and most
of the time there were areas to the side of the piste where we could find snow. I must admit, however, towards the end
of the week those areas became few and far between making it a very tiring on the legs.

On the plus side the resort itself wasn't that busy. I've been to other places that were rammed either due to popularity
or school holidays and having to constantly dodge people on the piste isn't much fun either.

This year we opted for a self catered chalet and rather than cooking ourselves we also ordered food pre-made to the the
chalet via a company called [Chalet Kitchen](https://www.chaletkitchen.com/). They delivered fresh baguettes and
breakfast each morning together with the evening's meal. I don't think there was a single night that we didn't enjoy the
meals. We had roasted duck, tagines, beef stews, pork sausage dishes, and chicken along with some fine deserts too. If
we ordered one of these again we might cut down on the amount of food as it was quite a lot to get through and we often
had food left over for the next day.
