Well it has been a long time between posts but I promise it is for a good reason. I have been busy learning. Learning
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Kotlin is a replacement for Java and has gained massive popularity on the Android

Kotlin. Whilst this sounds like it would be a great way to slowly migrate a large project this comes with some gotchas.

Over the course of trying to migrate two projects as well as spending time at work migrating to Kotlin I collected a set
of gotchas - or Kotchas - that presented to the SWmobile meet up group here in Bristol
