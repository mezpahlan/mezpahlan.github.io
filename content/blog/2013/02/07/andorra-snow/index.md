This week I'm with my girlfriend and her best friend for some snow fun in Andorra. Half way through the trip and I can
say with confidence that we are loving it! I have another trip with friends from work later on in March so wanted to use
this trip to perfect my technique on the snowboard. I also wanted to get my girlfriend interested in snow holidays since
they are the highlight of my year and I would love if she came to more of them with me.

For this trip I have purchased new bindings and a helmet camera. I haven't tried out the helmet camera yet because I am
shit scared of it getting damaged, but I will do later on when the weather is a bit better. The bindings are Flow and
they are amazing. I am having a bit of trouble fine tuning them for my foot, but so far they are great and I feel a lot
better in them.

The runs around this part of Andorra are incredible. We are staying half way between Soldeu and El Tarter. The resort is
one of the best I have been to and a quite a bit cheaper than the French ones. If you have doubts about Andorra then
release them from your mind! This place is great!

Hopefully I will get a chance to demo my camera in the next day or two and if I do I will post the videos here.

Anyway, back to the wine.
