Here's a nice, filling and tasty starter that could easily substitute as a main. A different take on the tomato
bruschetta starter. We modified this from a [BBC recipe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/buffalomozzarellabru_93627)
that we cooked for Valentine's Day. It's veggie friendly too!!

We removed the fennel (because we hate it), swapped the yellow courgette for regular courgette (easier to find in a
shop), left out the orange skin out (we forgot), swapped the sour dough bread with ciabatta (again, easier to find).

Ingredients:

* 1  courgette
* Small bunch fresh mint, torn into pieces
* Â½ lemon, juice only
* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 ciabatta bread<
* 1 garlic clove, peeled, cut in half lumps
* 125g buffalo mozzarella

Method:

Pop the ciabatta in the oven to heat up. This should take roughly ten minutes. Whilst this is heating up  in a bowl chop
the garlic, pour the a drop of olive oil, add the mint, add the lemon juice, add the salt and pepper.

By now your ciabatta should be completely heated through. Remove from the oven and slice into bruschetta sized sliced.
Pop these under the grill to get that toasted feel.

Whilst it is toasting, slice up the mozzarella and the courgette. Remove the ciabatta from the grill and drizzle some
more olive oil over them. Lay out the mixture from the bowl and the mozzarella with courgette. Serve with more crushed
black pepper and some prosecco.

Hmm tasty.
