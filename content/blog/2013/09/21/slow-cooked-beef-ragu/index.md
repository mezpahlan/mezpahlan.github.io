#### Ingredients:

* olive oil
* ~500g diced cuts of beef
* half onion, diced
* several garlic cloves, crushed
* several red chillies, chopped and finely diced
* 400g chopped tomatoes
* 300ml dark brown ale
* 200ml water
* 1 bay leaf
* 300g pappardelle, or any flat pasta
* small bunch flat-leaf parsley, chopped

#### Method:

In a pan add the olive oil and onions and gently heat. Prepare the garlic and chillies and add and continue to cook
until the colour changes to almost brown but not burnt.

In a large pot (one that is oven safe) add the beef and the ale along with the water and the bay leaf and finally the
tomatoes. Stir in the contents of the pan and cover with some foil.

Put in a pre-heated oven at 160 Â°C and let it slowly cook for 4 hours. About 15 minutes before the end boil the pasta
and chop the parsley. Stir the parsley into the pot and serve with the pasta, possibly some nice bread and a good glass
of wine.

Enjoy.
