Back on the cake making! This time with a sugar filled coffee cake that is easy peasy to make. I would leave this for
special occasions since the ingredients are rather rich and on the excessive side. Makes for a great cake!

Serves about 8. Adapted from Mary Berry's [recipe from the Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/9948208/Mary-Berrys-cappuccino-coffee-cake-recipe.html).

## Time:

About an hour twenty all in

## Ingredients:

*For the cake*

* 225g soft butter  
* 225g caster sugar  
* 225g self-raising flour  
* 1 tsp baking powder  
* 4 large eggs  
* 4 tsp ground coffee dissolved in 1 tbsp boiling water

*For the coffee icing*

* 175g soft butter  
* 350g icing sugar  
* 4 tsp ground coffee, dissolved in 1 tbsp boiling water

## Method:

Mix the butter, caster sugar, self raising flour, baking powder and eggs in a large bowl until creamy and cake mix
consistency like. Butter up some cake baking tins when you're done. Then stir in the coffee mixture. We used freshly
ground and brewed coffee from an espresso maker but if you don't have this to hand then instant coffee will do fine.

Put the mixture into cake tins (we ended up using two for these measurements) and place in an oven preheated to 180
&deg;C. Cook this for 35 - 40 minutes until the cake is soft and spongy.

Remove the cake tins and allow to cool. Separately to make the icing mix the rest of the ingredients in a bowl
thoroughly. When the cakes are cooled, remove carefully from the tins and slice horizontally in two. Apply the icing to
each half on the cake and reassemble. Add the icing to the top as well for good measure!

Enjoy with a drink...... coffee would be a good bet!!
