Come Autumn time, we will be taking a trip for two weeks around South Africa. This will be the first time I have visited
South Africa as well as Africa itself. I have a few friends from South Africa who always rave about it and many others
who have visited there and have recommended holidays there. This year I'm going to see it for myself!

I'll talk more about it later on in the year, I'm sure, but for now I wanted to prepare myself by eyeing out three
gadgets to take with me to make the trip a truly fantastic experience. Note, I could probably just take nothing and it
will be cool, but I'm pretty geeky so I can't resist!

First up is the [Fuji X-100](http://www.finepix-x100.com/). I always wanted a decent digital camera and have been
learning how to properly use a film SLR for about six years. I feel now is the time to capture some brilliant
photography on a digital format and this just looks the part! Quite decent reviews too (once you've upgraded the
firmware).

Next up is a tablet of some sorts. I haven't got into the whole tablet craze just yet, but I think the [Asus Transformer
Infinity](http://eee.asus.com/eeepad/transformer-infinity/features/) has worn me down. This I could probably do without,
but it would be nice to take a laptop around on holiday and this might just fit the bill without the excess weight of a
laptop. If nothing else, it will be nice to waste some time on the flight or the coach with one of these?

Lastly is an upgrade to my phone. I've been using the HTC Desire for over two years now and it has served me well. But
the poor camera and the ever waning battery life is starting to take its toll on me. Not to mention that feel I am
missing out without the very latest software version of Android which isn't coming to the phone. In its place I'm going
for the [Samsung Galaxy S3](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9300MBDBTU).
Hopefully this should last another fine two years again. From the reviews this is the best phone out there.......... so
far.

Anyways, all of this gadgetry is really just to capture every little bit of the South Africa holiday as I can. I want to
share all this with as many people as possible and finding an easy way to do that is key. Hopefully I'll get you show
you some great pictures and blog posts!
