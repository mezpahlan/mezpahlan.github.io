Today is wedding day.

Now, I don't know if you've been to a wedding where you don't know anyone but it is quite fun. You can people watch to
your heart's content and no one says anything.

Right now there is a table of old ladies with exceptional hats. I'm imagining that the one with the bright pink hat that
spans a metre is an old duchess of Ireland. A wealthy landlord. Someone that made it big in the twenties (yes she does
look that old) and retired after her husband passes away under mysterious circumstances. She is the baroness. Now, I
don't know if the Irish have dukes and barons but it is fun to imagine so.

The reception has an incredible singer singing old fifties tunes called Buck Taylor. At least I think that is his name.
What is it about fifties tunes that keep reoccurring at weddings? Have we not managed to move on and create better
wedding tunes?

Five Euros a drink. What recession?

Ahh random pram lady moving a well oversized pram onto everyone's feet. What ever happened to those McLaren buggies?
Fold up and hold that baby!

The dinner is lovely. A really great Irish steak. Also we're playing a little sweepstake on the speeches. We put ten
Euro each into a pint glass and pass it around every time they say, "Thanks". At the end of the speech the person with
the pint glass of money wins!

Butter nut squash followed by gin and tonic sorbet. Nice. Next up the steak! Oh the steak was so good! Irish rump steak
with one potato no sauce. Simply the steak. Divine!

Snuck out of the speeches to watch the England Euro 2012 game against Sweden. Three two into extra time. England won!

A massive fail at the dance floor. Crowd pleasing tunes that does nothing to rub me up. I've left to the bar after a
naff radio song about some twat that moves like Jagger. Fuck I hate that song!

One hour past midnight and I am sitting in a quiet alcove next to the bar. I hear the hiss of the pumps as they squirt
out Guinness and lager. I wonder if this is the last time they do this. It is not. Another customer orders a round.
Another pint that delays.

Nevertheless I have been suckered into a drink. A pint of beer. I don't think I can finish it. I'll have to find
creative ways of getting rid of it.
