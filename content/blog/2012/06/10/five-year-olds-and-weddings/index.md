Next week I'm off to Ireland for a few days to attend a wedding. I thought I had a suitable suit to wear but this turned
out not to be the case. I merely had a black pair of shoes. I don't think I even have suitable socks. Unless I try out
the Jacko look and go with white socks and black shoes? Somehow I don't think my girlfriend would be too impressed. So
this weekend I was ordered to buy a suit.

In comparison, my girlfriend already had a dress sorted and actually needed the shoes. About a day was spent on that
item alone. I'm not complaining... I'm just saying. Now all that remains is to find an appropriate shirt. I don't think
I'll wear a tie. Too stuffy. And I don't think we're going to colour coordinate my shirt and her shoes. No no no!

Also over that weekend is my girlfriend's nephew's fifth birthday. He wants a lunch box and pencil case for school. I
thought he should just optimise and put his sandwiches in one pocket and pencils in the other. Something tells me that
this won't go down too well but I'm sure he'll love it!

Whilst on our quest for a suit and shoes we walked all the way over to Clifton. Don't try that if you are scared of
hills but do if the weather is nice and you don't mind an up hill walk. Once there you'll be rewarded with impressive
old buildings and a lovely looking church. The weather was good to us so we walked around the green that was next to the
main council building.

Food wise I tried my hand at meatballs and spaghetti. One small pack of beef, chop half an onion, a whole garlic
chopped, two eggs, some olive oil, salt and pepper all in a bowl and mix. Leave it in the fridge for half an hour then
form into small balls. Fry until golden on both sides then put into tomato sauce that has been cooking separately. Add
some chilli to taste and serve with spaghetti. Lovely.
