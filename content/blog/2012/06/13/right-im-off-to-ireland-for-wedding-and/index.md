Right, I'm off to Ireland for a wedding and a five year old's birthday. Still more excited about the birthday party than
the wedding since I don't know anyone at the wedding and there will be a BBQ at the party. Who can win over a BBQ?
Exactly!

Today's actually quite nice in London. Sun is out with a few clouds, but much better than the wetness of the last couple
of days. It'll be a shame to go.

I spent my day rearranging my [Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) subscriptions. When and if I get a tablet, I think
this will be my new way to read blog feeds. As well as [Twitter](http://twitter.com/),
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and every other thing that comes out!
