This weekend is the diamond jubilee for the Queen. Here's a selection of pictures from the day.

It was a really rainy day right from the start. Not enough to put people off, but enough for you to get a bit wet.

As such we decided to drown ourselves in alcohol instead. I mean if we are going to get wet, then we might as well be
pissed.

There was a bizarre boat procession along the Thames. I swear they were practising an attack of some kind.

After watching the main bits of the ceremony, we decided to head back and play Wii sports instead. Luckily shops were
open so we picked up some rum and vodka and continued to *celebrate*. Quite a fun day!
