This week I'm in Tignes, France snowboarding with some friends from work.

Tignes is a lovely place with a really cool chilled out atmosphere. There are plenty of places to explore both on the
mountain and on the slopes.

What makes Tignes brilliant is the fact that you can go to Val D'Isere on the same lift pass. This opens your trip up to
a glacier and lots more fantastic runs. Two resorts in one!

So far I've been sticking to pretty easy slopes since it is a bit icy in places which isn't good if you're a boarder.
Nothing injured so far! Managed a couple of red runs but mostly sticking to blues and greens.

By the end of the week I managed to increase my speed on my toe edge and gain more confidence going down steep runs.
Moguls are easy for me now, although they still take it out of my legs, so I still try and find an easier route around
them.

All in all, I loved the trip and would like to go again.
