I've been waiting to port my number over from [O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/). Not impressed with the state of affairs around
internal number porting that has lead me here. To recap I purchased a second contract on
[T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/) with a fancy new phone ([Samsung Galaxy
S3](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9300MBDBTU)) because it was cheaper than
an upgrade.

First off that has to be wrong. I am a loyal customer with a desire to stay on the network for another two years and
they can't offer me an upgrade that is cheaper than a brand new customer. It's not just T-Mobile, that was the case with
*every* network.

My only option, I was told, was to get the second contract and cancel my old contract. T-Mobile still only have one
contract with me. I'm actually paying more for this new contract but apparently they couldn't even match this on an
upgrade. This is telling me that they valued my upgrade so little they were happy to charge me more than market price
for the upgrade. Fine, I get to be a brand new customer again.

One problem. I'm left with a new number. This isn't in itself a problem. I like keeping my old number however so I
wanted to see if I could port my old contract number over to my new one before I closed it down. I was told not. Even
though I was going to close that old contract down? Apparently still no. This seems odd to me. And the solution even
odder. I was told the only way to achieve this is to port my number out to a different network and then port it back
again.

So I started this process and sadly found out that O2 wouldn't give me a porting code for a month. Fair enough. I can't
complain with that. I had no intention of using their network so the least I could do was stay for a minimum term.

That month has arrived! Today I will be able to port my number back again and really start using my phone. I'll post a
review shortly of what I think.

That's the crazy situation we're in.Had a similar experience? Let me know in the comments.
