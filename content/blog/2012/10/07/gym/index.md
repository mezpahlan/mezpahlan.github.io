This past month I've been trying out a new exercise routine. It involves high intensity interval training and more
weights than I would normally do. The idea is to stimulate my body to have a higher proportion of lean muscle than fat.
So far it has worked well! Muscle seems to burn off a lot more excess weight whilst I'm not at the gym than long
distance running that I used to do.

I'm not a gigantic muscle man though. And I still have a few troubles with the diet, but it is probably the best diet
and exercise regime that I have stuck to. The diet is simply lots of water, regular small portions, increase in protein
through chicken turkey and beef and fewer carbohydrates like rice chips and potatoes. I have to be careful here since
cutting down and shifting my diet in such a small amount of time is hard to do correctly. Nevertheless, I'm finding my
balance.

I've found a great place for lunch near St. Paul's in London that is essentially a butchers. They also cook their own
meat and serve it up for lunch. It is really delicious. I recommend it if you're after a similar diet. Cheap too! Here's
the link. [Porterford Butchers](http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1157/41246.php).
