Only a few weeks to go until we travel to South Africa for a two week holiday and nothing but sun!

Ok there will be more than just sun. There will also be (in no particular order) wine, trekking, cycles, penguins,
beaches, pools, wine, penguins, safari, wine, fine food and penguins.

The theme is definitely wine and penguins! Although I can't wait to see the rest of the country which I hear is lovely!

I had intended to get the new [Fuji X-E1](http://www.fujifilm.eu/uk/products/digital-cameras/pro-enthusiast/model/x-e1/)
but sadly this isn't available in the UK before we leave. It looks like a lovely camera and is getting some great
previews. The test shots that I've seen look great. I'm still taking with me my [Pentax ME
Super](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentax_ME_Super) which is my current SLR (that's SLR not DSLR) for which I've
recently purchased eleven roles of thirty six exposures. That should do nicely! My two regrets here are the fact that it
is going to cost me a tonne in processing and that I don't have zoom lenses for the safari. You can't win them all!
