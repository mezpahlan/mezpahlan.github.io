This weekend I completed two activities. The first was finish reading Frankenstein and the second was to finish a wheel
of cheese from Cheddar.

Firstly the book. Frankenstein was an enjoyable read but completely not as I remember. In fact what I remember is the
Hollywood tale of Frankenstein and not actually the true source material.

The book has many similarities with the classic Hollywood tale but it is also strikingly different in that the monster
is an eloquent and intelligent being. There is even a whole chapter where the monster gives a review of three books he
read whilst hiding in a hovel. This certainly wasn't very frightening and I much prefer the interpretation where the
monster has base feelings and emotions however can't express them in words. I think this lends more pathos to the tale
of a monster who was brought to life by accident and struggles to find a place in a world where no one will accept him.

Nevertheless the talking version of the monster was very interesting. I felt no sympathy for Frankenstein. I thought he
was a proper idiot through and through. Selfish and short sighted, he deserved everything the monster wrought upon him.

Now the cheese!

The cheese was from a gorge in Cheddar and purchase by my friend Tom who is cycling around the UK at the moment and
stopped off to share some chat, cheese and port. I'm afraid I can't place the actual variety of cheddar but it has a
very strong after taste that to me taste like mustard. Very nice and really yummy melted over some toast!
