For the May Bank holiday, we spent the time in Bristol.

Weather lovely, check. Food brilliant, check. Music awesome, check!

Highlights were taking a river cruise from Temple Meads to the SS Great Britain stopping off at the Cottage Inn for
lunch. We'll try to go to the observatory and the zoo which is a few short minutes walk away.

Also on Saturday went to see an album launch for Yes Sir Boss. A local Bristol band that played some wicked good music
and had a horn section. Really brilliant atmosphere and tight vocals. Loved it.

See you later Bristol!
