This weekend we took our favourite little penguin, Sean, to Bristol Zoo. It was incredibly hot this weekend in the U.K.
so it was a good chance to get out and about. I think Sean liked it too!

We left London quite early and caught the slow train to Bristol. Thankfully the train had air conditioning. Anne-Marie
is reading [Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen) and I was reading [What Would Google
Do](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis#Publications). Sean was of course gazing out of the window at the lovely
English countryside.

Getting to the zoo was harder that you'd imagine but it turned out that we took the long way around. I actually quite
enjoyed the long way round since the weather was lovely and we could afford to kill a few hours. We walked to the
central area in Bristol with all the boats and hopped on a river boat that, for two quid each, took us to [The
Cottage](http://www.butcombe.com/pubs_cottage_inn.shtml). We then took a bus from around the corner to the zoo through
Clifton Park. Stunning area. Really very nice. Glad we took the bus since it would have been a good forty minute walk up
hill and in the heat.

When we got there we had one thing in mind, to show Sean his penguin cousins. So we headed straight for the penguin
enclosure and saw a show a brief talk whilst the penguins were being fed.

Other highlights were the meerkats that were extremely cute and the gorillas that were unbelievably close up. A shame
that they were in a small room but it meant that you could see them up close. A little sad.

All in all I'd recommend going to [Bristol Zoo](http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/). Especially when the weather is like this!
