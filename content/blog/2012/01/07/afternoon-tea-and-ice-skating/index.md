Today we went to have afternoon tea at the [Washington Mayfair Hotel](http://www.washington-mayfair.co.uk/). Nice place
and lovely atmosphere but I don't think I'd come here again. Staff are friendly enough and at Â£25 a head for afternoon
tea including a cocktail, the price isn't bad. What spoiled it is the poor quality of the food and drinks. Tasted like
it was pre packed and not made up fresh.

I'm probably being a bit too harsh since it was all very edible but it is not what you want from afternoon tea. You want
a bit of snobbery for your money. You want to taste freshly made sandwiches. You want the finest quality gin and tonic.
Otherwise you might as well buy some cheap bubbles and make home made cakes?

Over all I'd give it a six out of ten.

I also stopped off at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/) to pick up my girlfriend and her friend from
the ice skating. They are both pro skaters so I felt a bit inadequate and didn't join them. As ever though, the ice rink
was lovely and from the looks of it is proving to be one of the best outdoor seasonal ice rinks in London. Sadly this
weekend is the last of the year until it opens again in December. Well worth a trip down there even if the session is
only an hour.
