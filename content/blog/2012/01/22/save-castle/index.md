Sad news has reached us. Our beloved Castle has just learned that a planning application has been sent to the council to
knock it down and build apartments and a parking lot!

Go to [wandsworth.gov.uk find a planning
application](http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/info/1023/planning_advice_and_guidance/364/find_a_planning_application) and
search for application number 2012/0229 to protest and keep track of the application.

Spread the word and appeal this application. The Castle is not merely a pub but a local place of community for the
residents in the area and, like me, for people outside the area.

It simply is a gem in London. Warm friendly staff and a fantastic local atmosphere.

Go on down there and have a pint and a chat. Treat yourself to the above excellent food and relax by the fireplace.
[http://www.castlebattersea.co.uk/](http://www.castlebattersea.co.uk/). Stop this absurd application from being
approved. It seems crazy to knock down a place of community for overpriced flats.

Spread the word. Tweet #savethecastle and tell all your friends on Facebook to do the same.
