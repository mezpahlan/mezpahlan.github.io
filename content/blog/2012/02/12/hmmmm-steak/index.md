Yesterday I was hungry so I chanced my arm at cooking a steak. I've never tried cooking a steak before and didn't really
know what I was doing when I started but here is what I did. For record, I followed the cooking suggestions on the back
of the steak packet and didn't just wing it!

1. Put chips in oven (this was the easy part)
2. Heat a pan to a mega hot temperature (instructions recommend a thick based pan. I didn't have one so probably wrecked
   the pan I did have)
3. Lightly baste the steak with butter (I didn't have butter so instead used chilli oil that I use in noodles)
4. Heat steak on both sides for 90 seconds each (simples)
5. Cook the edges (a bit tricky when you have smoke and oil spitting everywhere but doable)
6. Depending on thickness cook for an extra 3 minutes for medium rare (also simple but then I put the steak in the oven
   to keep warm. Probably went over 3 minutes at that point)
7. Serve with whatever seasoning you desire (this should have been the first step but I forgot so put pepper on the
   steak at the end)

I want to try a rib eye steak next and also try and make a nice sauce (I didn't have anything but HP Ketchup...... yuk)

All in all, an enjoyable experience. You need to be very tight on the timing if you want to get the steak cooked to your
liking but it certainly didn't put me off doing another one.

I recommend opening a window because a lot of smoke comes out. And get a thick pan or else you'll rip through pans in no
time.

Then I drunk a bottle of wine........... hmmmmmmmm.
