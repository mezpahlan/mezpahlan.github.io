latest news.

You can also now comment on the planning application
[here](http://planning.wandsworth.gov.uk/WAM/showCaseFile.do?appType=planning&amp;appNumber=2012/0341). If you care
about The Castle and have enjoyed your time there and (like everyone) don't want to see it torn down then please leave a
comment. It only take a few minutes.

I suggest you make your objections known as this is an effective way to raise awareness to the council.
