Week two and I'll just keep things brief. As we move through the Western Cape into the Eastern and then up into the
Northern Cape the Internet availability at hotels and restaurants gets sparser and sparser.

#### South Africa Day Seven

We spend a final night in the Garden Route with a stop off at Knysna where we sample oysters for the first time on the
holiday. Large and fresh the oysters are served up with Tabasco sauce and broken pepper corns. I prefer them this way
since it takes the edge off the salty brine water which I'm not too keen on.

We also found time to take a dip in the pool which was one of the best so far on the holiday. Whether it was heated or
had just the right amount of sun shining down, it was perfect for a lounge about and a swim.

#### South Africa Day Eight

We drove down to Tsitsikamma and took some more tourist spots in. This day was the start of a lot of driving but the
scenery was still good and the food as ever was lovely. Tsitsikamma had a nature trail that we walked whilst waiting for
our food. The trail started and stopped at the restaurant so that worked out nicely!

Port Elizabeth was our final stop before getting on a plane to Johannesburg the next day. We didn't have long in Port
Elizabeth but I didn't mind since it wasn't as nice as the Garden Route destinations. It had a lot of history that I
have quickly forgotten to do with ostrich feathers and such stuff but that was about it.

#### South Africa Day Nine

Today we travel to Johannesburg and take a tour of Soweto. Soweto is a shortening of South Western Townships. It has
quickly thrived into a city with the city of Johannesburg. We visited the old home of Nelson Mandela and had lunch at a
local Soweto restaurant called Chez Alina. Let me tell you the food and the people are incredible! Well recommended for
a visit. We were then treated to a traditional Zulu dance and waved goodbye to the township.

I should also recommend the history of Soweto and its place in the uprisings in South Africa as a must for a visit. The
history is unforgettable.

To end the night we had dinner at The Butcher Bar And Grill in Johannesburg which is a fancy steak house. I had the
Waygu beef rump from Australia which was delicious yet sickly at the time. If you order it then skip starters, don't
have any bread and possibly split it between two since it is very rich and filling. Lovely but I wouldn't have a whole
one again.

Next stop, Kruger Safari!
