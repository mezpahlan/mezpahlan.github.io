Easter has begun Ireland with the eating of chocolate eggs.

It's been lovely coming back here even if this time the weather is not the usual tropical picture it was last time. This
trip we'll be going to to Kerry and Dublin as well as taking part in the Titanic celebrations that are happening all
this week. Apparently, a dozen or so of the seventy Irish people who died on the Titanic were from the Adergoole parish.
A replica has been built as well as numerous activities to mark the occasion. Personally I don't quite understand the
ceremony. We don't celebrate other ship disasters like we do the Titanic and certainly not this long after the event.
Anyway, I'll be enjoying the people and food and will be taking some black and white photos at every opportunity I can
find.
